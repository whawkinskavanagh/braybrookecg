    <p>
        My name is Cerys Jones.<br></br><br></br> 
        I am the Landlady of the Public house in Braybrooke and also reside in the village.
       <br></br><br></br>
       In my spare time I like visiting my cottage in Port Isaac with my partner and our two dogs Henry and Cody.
       <br></br><br></br>
       I recently bought a cricut and a sublimation printer so I can create all kinds of crafting things for the pub.  Such as personalised t-shirts for events.  Mugs, glassware and other items. 
       <br></br><br></br>
       During covid lockdown one, I created my very own gin which we now sell online or in The Swan.
