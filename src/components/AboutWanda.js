        My name is Wanda Hawkins-Kavanagh.<br></br>  
        I live in Braybrooke.
        I like sewing, knitting and coming up with craft ideas with my cricut joy.
        <br></br> 
       In my other spare time I like visiting English Heritage locations with my Doberman Diesel.
       <br></br> 
       I've been sewing since Lockdown one when I completed an online sewing diploma to distinction.
       <br></br> 
       My nan taught me how to knit when I was 7 years old.
